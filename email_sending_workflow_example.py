The main recruiting coordinator agent should handle email requests like this:

Agent Response:
1. "I'll help you send an email to Alex Sandu at Google. Let me first find his email address."
2. [Calls email_discovery_agent to find email]
3. "I found Alex's email: alex@google.com (confidence: 85%)"

6. "Email verification successful. Now I'll send the email."
7. [Calls email_sender_agent to send email]
8. "Email sent successfully to alex@google.com with subject 'Job Opportunity'"
