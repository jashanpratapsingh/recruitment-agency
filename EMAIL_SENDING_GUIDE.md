# Email Sending Guide

This guide explains how to use the email sending capabilities integrated with the Email Discovery Agent in the Recruiting Agency chatbot.

## Overview

The Email Discovery Agent now includes comprehensive email sending functionality that allows you to:

- Send individual emails with HTML content and attachments
- Send bulk personalized emails to multiple recipients
- Create and execute email campaigns
- Send follow-up emails with delays
- Integrate email discovery with email sending workflows

## Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Set up your email credentials in environment variables:

```bash
export BD_AGENT_EMAIL='your-email@gmail.com'
export BD_AGENT_EMAIL_PASSWORD='your-app-password'
```

**Important Notes:**
- For Gmail, you must use an **App Password**, not your regular password
- Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
- Generate an App Password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
- The App Password is a 16-character code that looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`

### 2. Gmail Setup

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to Security â†’ App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this password in `BD_AGENT_EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### 3. Alternative Email Providers

The system defaults to Gmail but supports other SMTP providers:

```bash
# For Outlook/Hotmail
export SMTP_SERVER='smtp-mail.outlook.com'
export SMTP_PORT='587'

# For Yahoo
export SMTP_SERVER='smtp.mail.yahoo.com'
export SMTP_PORT='587'

# For custom SMTP
export SMTP_SERVER='your-smtp-server.com'
export SMTP_PORT='587'
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   ```
   Error: Email credentials not found
   Solution: Set BD_AGENT_EMAIL and BD_AGENT_EMAIL_PASSWORD
   ```

2. **SMTP Connection Errors**
   ```
   Error: Failed to connect to SMTP server
   Solution: Check internet connection and SMTP settings
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```
   Error: Too many emails sent
   Solution: Add delays between emails and respect limits
   ```

4. **Invalid Email Format**
   ```
   Error: Invalid email address
   Solution: Verify email format before sending
   ```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Logging**
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Test with Dry Run**
   ```python
   # Always test with dry_run=True first
   response = email_discovery_agent.run(
       "Send email with dry_run=True"
   )
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```python
   import os
   print(f"Email: {os.getenv('BD_AGENT_EMAIL')}")
   print(f"Password set: {'Yes' if os.getenv('BD_AGENT_EMAIL_PASSWORD') else 'No'}")
   ```

## Integration with Chatbot

The email sending functionality is fully integrated with the recruiting agency chatbot. You can use it directly in conversations:

```
User: "Find the email for John Smith at Google and send him a partnership proposal"

Agent: I'll help you find John Smith's email and send a partnership proposal. Let me start by searching for his email address...

[Agent finds email and sends proposal with dry_run=True for safety]
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode email credentials
2. **App Passwords**: Use app passwords instead of regular passwords
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect email provider limits
4. **Content Filtering**: Avoid spam trigger words
5. **Authentication**: Use proper SMTP authentication

## Monitoring and Analytics

Track your email campaigns:

1. **Send Status**: Monitor success/failure rates
2. **Delivery Rates**: Track email delivery success
3. **Response Rates**: Monitor recipient engagement
4. **Bounce Rates**: Track invalid email addresses
5. **Spam Complaints**: Monitor reputation

## Support

For issues with email sending:

1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Gmail App Password is working
3. Test with dry_run=True first
4. Check SMTP server settings
5. Monitor error logs for specific issues
